## Summary

_Play and learn with Me_ is an educational safe Android app that could be used by 4-6 years old children to practice their knowledge of the numbers in an interactive way. This app assumes that the child knows already some numbers and it is designed to strengthen their knowledge. The tracing lines activities will develop his or her ability to follow the dotted line and stay on track.  

## Intended users

 * Parents and children who prefer gadgets instead of books and take this as a more interesting way of learning.
 
> As a parent of a 5-year-old child, I was paying attention to how a lot of parents use tablets and phones on their kids, I thought that creating such an app it will add usefulness to the time children spend on gadgets.

* Parents who travel a lot and long distances with their children and intend to keep them interested in learning on the way by using a fun environment.

> As a parent with experience in long flights with a child, I can say that this kind of travels are not easy to survive. So, even for parents that are not so permissive with gadgets, as I find myself, this educational app is a good way to keep them busy when the parent cannot bring along too many entertainment staff.

## Functionality

* The app will appear divided into two options _NUMBERS_ and _MAZE AND TRACING LINES_. Selecting one option inside will be the button start that will give the first activity where will be an example already solved to show the child how to do.

* The user will have the option to play with _NUMBERS_. This section will contain different activities with numbers from 1-20. Some examples of activities are matching the number with the right picture; dragging with the finger the missing number and placing it in the right place (under an image of a train with wagons where each wagon has a number but there are empty wagons, too). 

* The user will have another option - _MAZE AND TRACING LINES_. This section will contain simple examples of maze or tracing lines. This could be represented e.g. as a wavy line where the child with the finger will drag a car from one point to the other.
