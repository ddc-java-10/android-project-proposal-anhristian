## Summary

**Play and learn with Me** is an educational safe Android app that could be used by 4-6 years old children to practice interactively their knowledge of the numbers. This app assumes that the child knows already some numbers and it is designed to strengthen their knowledge. 

## Intended users

 * Parents and children who prefer gadgets instead of books and take this as a more interesting way of learning.
 
> As a parent of a 5-year-old child, I was paying attention to how a lot of parents use tablets and phones on their kids, I thought that creating such an app it will add usefulness to the time children spend on gadgets.

* Parents who travel a lot and long distances with their children and intend to keep them interested in learning on the way by using a fun environment.

> As a parent with experience in long flights with a child, I can say that these kinds of travels are not easy to survive. So, even for parents that are not so permissive with gadgets, as I find myself, this educational app is a good way to keep them busy when the parent cannot bring along too many entertainment staff.

## Functionality

The user will have the option to do different activities with **NUMBERS**. He or she could scroll them and choose the one he or she wants to do. Each activity will have an example already solved to show the child how to work. Some examples of activities could be matching the number with the right picture; dragging with the finger the missing number and placing it in the right place. This could be an example of an easy visualization: an image of a train with wagons where each wagon has a number but there are empty wagons, too where the child will drag the correct number.


## Persistent data

* The last play session with the last activity.
* Successful and unsuccessful completion of the activities;
    
## Device/external services

* Google Sign In
* Device's speaker

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

* Being kind of an app with tutorial content will be useful to add Text To Speech (TTS) feature to it, which will say back to the child the number he selected. Additionaly, the voiced instructions could tell what is supposed to be done in that activity.

* An addtional activity section could be added with simple examples of tracing lines. This could be represented e.g. as a wavy line where the child with the finger will drag a car from one point to the other.
